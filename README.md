Guns of Icarus players xedeon, HelFyre, FadedSilhoutte, Dementio, SlyCrossfox, Genesis and Kruegerz are bullies. The abuser Inkjet has not only been misusing the position as Muse community manager to protect those bullies but is actively helping them in attacking their victims. Muse Games head Howard Tsao (aka Bubbles) is aware of this abuse going on but has chosen to silence me instead of rooting out the abusers and bullies in Muse and the community. Now it is up to you to speak up.

Bullies don't always realize the gravity of what they are doing. When you are however not only ignoring those that ask you to stop but take active steps to block them out there is no doubt that you are intentionally malicious. Stop this. Stop enabling bullies.

Stop this insanity. Stop making excuses for abuse. Stop helping abusers hide their abuse. Stop helping bullies get away with bullying. Stop turning a blind eye when asked to stop this. Stop pretending that you can't do anything. Stop thinking this does not concern you. If you refuse to listen to victims because the truth is inconvenient then you too become party to the abuse. Stop this inhumanity.
